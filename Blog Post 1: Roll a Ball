Roll a Ball Project
Introduction
Aim of this Roll a Ball project was to show us fundamentals in Unity. Such as creating a player, designing space, work with fundamentals of camera work and physics.
Reflection
The first time I opened Unity my first thought was "I'm so going to fail this subject" because everything looked so difficult. I also managed to switch camera to some perspective and couldn't bring it back so that was supper annoying,
After few lessons I already feel a bit more comfortable with Unity and I understand which objects are there. Most difficult part for me was camera related stuff because lot of words that I don't know meaning to were there for example offset.
I have experience with C# so coding part was pretty self explanatory and I really liked how slow they showed everything in tutorial I never felt overwhelmed with informations or had to turn back video.
I really liked the tutorial and I think it taught me a lot. I'm really looking forward to next project we have and then ultimately final Project.
